/**
This function, `parseAST`, is responsible for traversing an abstract syntax tree (AST) generated from a GraphQL query and extracting relevant information to create a template for various operations related to GraphQL query processing. Let's break down the key components and functionality of this function:

**Parameters**:
- `AST` (Object): The abstract syntax tree generated by a GraphQL library. It represents the structure of the GraphQL query.
- `options` (Object, optional): An object for user-supplied options. In this function, it's primarily used to extract a user-defined ID, but its integration is not fully implemented.

**Returns**:
- `proto` (Object): This is the prototype object that will serve as a template for various operations related to caching, building modified queries, and more.
- `operationType` (string): It represents the type of GraphQL operation, which can be 'query', 'mutation', 'subscription', 'noID', or 'unQuellable'.
- `frags` (Object): This object contains information about the fragments defined in the query. It's structured similarly to `proto`.

**Functionality**:
1. Initialization: The function initializes various data structures, including `proto` (the prototype object), `frags` (for fragments), `operationType` (for the GraphQL operation type), `stack` (a stack to keep track of the depth-first parsing path), `fieldArgs` (to store field arguments), and `userDefinedID` (extracted from the `options` parameter).

2. Depth-First Traversal: The function uses the `visit` utility provided by the `graphql-JS` library to perform a depth-first traversal of the AST. During traversal, it invokes specific callback functions for different types of nodes encountered in the AST.

3. Callbacks for Node Types:
   - `enter` callback for various node types: This function is called when entering different types of nodes in the AST. For example, it checks if a node has directives and marks the operation as 'unQuellable' if directives are present. It also identifies the operation type by examining the `OperationDefinition` node.

   - `OperationDefinition` callback: This function specifically handles the `OperationDefinition` node, determining whether it's a 'subscription' operation and marking it as 'unQuellable' if it is.

   - `FragmentDefinition` callback: This function handles `FragmentDefinition` nodes, extracting the fragment name, adding it to the `stack`, and initializing an entry in the `frags` object for the fragment.

   - `Field` callback: This function is called when entering a `Field` node, which represents a field in the query. It handles various aspects of the field, including arguments, aliases, and field-specific options. It also tracks the field type, adds arguments to `argsObj`, and determines the `__id` field.

4. `SelectionSet` Handling: The function also handles `SelectionSet` nodes, which represent sub-fields within a field. It constructs a `fieldsObject` to collect fields as it loops through the selections. It checks if the field includes a fragment spread and includes fields not contained within a nested object.

5. Caching and Templates: The function constructs a `proto` object by combining information from various parts of the traversal. It uses the `stack` to determine the path within `proto` where fields should be added. The function also checks if the query lacks an 'id' field and marks it as 'noID' if necessary.

6. Returning Results: Finally, the function returns the `proto` object, the `operationType`, and the `frags` object as the result.

In summary, this function is crucial for analyzing GraphQL queries, extracting relevant information, and creating a template (`proto`) that can be used for various operations in GraphQL query processing, including caching and query modification. It also identifies the type of operation and tracks fragments defined in the query.
